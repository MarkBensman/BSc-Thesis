This repository contains code and simulation data from the bachelor thesis: "Influence of Different Input Parameters on Information Transfer Capabilities of Excitatory and Inhibitory Spiking Neurons".

The code depends on the work:

https://github.com/DepartmentofNeurophysiology/Dynamic-clamp-information-protocol

Code files must be placed in /code/foundations/ folder.

Scale_calc.py - Calculation of scaling multiplier.

Functions.py - Various functions used throughout.

Experiment.py - Once scaling is established, full simulation can commence.
